  Hi! Welcome to my website!
<h1>

</p>
<p>
  I'm Bee! I love games, art, cartoons, and red pandas.
  I'm also kind of a nerd.
  You might already know of me from the <a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/bebebea_loste/">Minecraft modding community</a>.
  I do resource packs and data packs sometimes.
</p>
<p>
  This is mainly intended to be a simple blog where I can post random stuff every now and then.
  I'm quite scatterbrained, so projects I work on I usually move on from quickly and I can never really settle on anything.
  But, as of right now, I'm working on projects primarily in GameMaker.
  I figured why not share a few interesting tidbits with the world as well!
</p>
<p>
  I hope you'll find something interesting or useful here! ^^
