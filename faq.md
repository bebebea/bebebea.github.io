**Do you have a Discord server?**  
Nuh-uh.

**Will you make a Discord server?**  
No such plans!!

**Minecraft projects: Can I use, remix, derive from or redistribute your work?**  
If your use case is private, i.e. you're not sharing it with everyone on the internet, then absolutely, do whatever you like!  
If it is public, you're still more than free to use it in a server or in a modpack! No crediting is needed!  
For other uses, probably contact me?
